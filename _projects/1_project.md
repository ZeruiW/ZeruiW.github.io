## Project Workflow

### Environment Setup

We start by loading environment variables and registering API keys to ensure secure access to various data sources:

### Data Processing

Utility functions handle data saving, loading, and formatting to streamline the analysis process:

```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import date

def save_output(data: pd.DataFrame, tag: str, save_path: str = None) -> None:
    if save_path:
        data.to_csv(save_path)
        print(f"{tag} saved to {save_path}")

def get_current_date():
    return date.today().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
```

### AI Configuration

Setting up the AI agents with appropriate configurations to ensure precise and efficient analysis:

```python
import autogen

config_list = [
    {
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "api_key": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    }
]
llm_config = {"config_list": config_list, "timeout": 120, "temperature": 0}

analyst = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="Market_Analyst",
    system_message="As a Market Analyst, ...",
    llm_config=llm_config,
)

user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    name="User_Proxy",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=10,
)
```

### Tool Registration

Registering tools for data retrieval and analysis ensures a seamless flow of information:

```python
from finrobot.toolkits import register_toolkits
from finrobot.data_source import FinnHubUtils, YFinanceUtils

tools = [
    {
        "function": FinnHubUtils.get_company_profile,
        "name": "get_company_profile",
        "description": "get a company's profile information"
    },
    {
        "function": FinnHubUtils.get_company_news,
        "name": "get_company_news",
        "description": "retrieve market news related to designated company"
    },
    {
        "function": FinnHubUtils.get_basic_financials,
        "name": "get_financial_basics",
        "description": "get latest financial basics for a designated company"
    },
    {
        "function": YFinanceUtils.get_stock_data,
        "name": "get_stock_data",
        "description": "retrieve stock price data for designated ticker symbol"
    }
]
register_toolkits(tools, analyst, user_proxy)
```

### Interactive Interface

Creating an interactive interface using Gradio, allowing users to easily access and interact with the analysis tool:

```python
import gradio as gr

iface = gr.Interface(
    fn=analyze_company,
    inputs=gr.Textbox(lines=1, placeholder="Enter company name or stock code"),
    outputs=gr.Markdown(label="Trade-Helper"),
    title="Trade-Helper",
    description="Enter the company name or stock code to get a AI-Powered analysis and forecast prediction.",
    css=custom_css,
    allow_flagging='never'
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    iface.launch(share=True)
```
